I am a doctoral researcher at the [CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security](https://cispa.de) in Saarbr√ºcken, Germany.
Previously, I received my M.S. and B.S. in computer science from [Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en).

My research interests are in the intersection of formal methods, security protocol verification, and runtime verification.
I apply automated reasoning techniques to analyze novel protocol designs and use concepts from runtime verification to establish security guarantees for security-critical applications.
